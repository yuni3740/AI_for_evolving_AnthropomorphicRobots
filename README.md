## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop intelligent, anthropomorphic robots capable of evolving through interaction with their surroundings. This involves using machine learning algorithms, data structures, and effective project management techniques to create a robust system.

## Features

- **Learning Algorithms**: Implemented various algorithms that allow robots to learn from experience.
- **Real-time Debugging**: Tools to monitor and debug robot behavior in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed using Jupyter Notebooks for easy interaction and visualization.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear markdown documentation to guide users through the project.
- **Integration with Unity**: Enabled visualization of robotic movements and behaviors in a 3D environment.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a range of technologies and tools, including:

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy for numerical computations
  - OpenCV for computer vision tasks
- **Documentation Tools**: Markdown for project documentation
- **Project Management**: Git and GitHub for version control
- **Office Tools**: Microsoft Office suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) for reporting and presentations
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for interaction with external services
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks for code execution and visualization
- **Game Development**: Unity for simulating robot behavior
